### Submitting an Issue
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our repository. Before you submit your issue, search open and closed issues, maybe your question was already answered.

### Creating a pull request
* All pull requests must be associated with a specific Issue. If an issue doesn't exist please create it.
* Before you submit your pull request, please make sure that your pull request doesn't create any duplicates by searching open/closed pull requests. 
* For commiting in your Pull Request, You can checkout [Commits](#commits) for more.

### Coding Rules
* Please make sure to use swift (instead of ObjC) wherever possible.
* Write the comments wherever it's needed.
* Please remove the unnecessary/unused code before committing.

* Swift code should generally follow the conventions listed at https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide.
### Commits
* Each commit should have a single clear purpose. If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, those changes should be split into separate commits.
* If a commit requires another commit to build properly, those commits should be squashed.
